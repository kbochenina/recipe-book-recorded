# Pancakes

## Ingredients
  - 1 cup (125 g) all-purpose flour
  - 2 tbsp sugar
  - 1 tsp baking powder
  - ½ tsp baking soda
  - ¼ tsp salt
  - 1 cup (240 ml) buttermilk (or milk + 1 tsp vinegar/lemon juice)
  - 1 large egg
  - 2 tbsp melted butter (plus extra for cooking)

## Instructions
  - Mix dry ingredients: In a bowl, whisk together flour, sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.
  - Mix wet ingredients: In another bowl, whisk buttermilk, egg, melted butter, and vanilla.
  - Combine: Pour wet into dry. Stir just until combined (a few lumps are fine — don’t overmix).
  - Rest batter: Let it sit for 5 minutes while you heat the pan.
  - Cook: Heat a nonstick pan over medium heat, lightly grease with butter. Pour about ¼ cup of batter per pancake.
  - Cook until bubbles form on the surface and edges look set (about 2 min).
  - Flip and cook another 1–2 min until golden.
  - Serve: Stack warm pancakes with butter, maple syrup, berries, or your favorite toppings.
